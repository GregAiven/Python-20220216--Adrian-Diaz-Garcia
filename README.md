# Python-20220216--Adrian-Diaz-Garcia

This project will ping some websites and will try to match a regex in its content (html).
Results will be sent to a Kafka topic and after to a postgresql database.

### Monitor

Monitor component will iterate over the websites defined in settings.py file, make a request a match the pattern provided
Format of the website structure is:

```python
# Configure here urls and patterns to search on the webs
WEBS = [
    {"url": "https://www.google.es/", "pattern": r"search"},
    {"url": "https://www.google.es/", "pattern": r"look"},
    {"url": "https://www.google.es/", "pattern": r"wat"},
    {"url": "https://www.amazon.es/", "pattern": r"Prime"},
    {"url": "https://www.amazon.es/", "pattern": r"Adrian"},
]
```

The different fields that monitor will generate are:

- *http_status*: HTTP status request status
- *check_result*: True if regex was found in the content, False otherwise
- *elapsed*: Time in seconds the request took to complete
- *regex*: Regex used to assert in the content
- *url*: Requested URL

Once those stats are collected, they are pushed to a Kafka topic (default: web_checks) to be consumed by the ETL component.

### ETL

ETL component is in charge of consuming the messaged generated by the Monitor component and storing them into a PostgreSQL

### PostgreSQL 

Currently this implementation only uses one table called "check_results" under the public schema.
The table creation statement is 

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.check_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    url text NOT NULL,
    regex text NOT NULL,
    http_status integer NOT NULL,
    check_result boolean NOT NULL,
    elapsed float NOT NULL,
    created TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT Now());
```

Under scripts folder there is an initdb.sh script which is taking care of the creation of the table (as in this project no ORM has been used).


## ⚙ Features

### Development features

- Supports for `Python 3.9` and higher.
- [`Pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) as the dependencies manager, requirements can be found in requirements.txt file.
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort).
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

### Open source community features

- [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).


## 🚀 Quick start

> Note: to see more details to execute tests, linting and other extras, see `Makefile usage` section

In order to build and execute the example main program (a.k.a. start monitor some websites defined in settings.py inside the monitor package ):

```
make build
make up
```

### How to configure regex and websites

Edit file in [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort).

> Requirements: you must have docker installed and running
> 
## 🖖Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/GregAiven/Python-20220216--Adrian-Diaz-Garcia/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Building local images</summary>
<p>

```bash
make build
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Tests</summary>
<p>

Running tests inside docker containers using pytest:

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make black isort
```

Codestyle rewrite files and format them:


> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` library
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Linters</summary>
<p>

Current used linter is flake8

```bash
make flake8
```
